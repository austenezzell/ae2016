          <p>Iâ€™m a designer <b>/</b> art director <b>/</b> front-end developer focused on crafting useful and enjoyable digital product experiences. I have a BS in economics and experience in e-commerce, advertising, UX, UI and front-end development.</p>
          <p>I am currently UX Lead at <a href="http://www.cincodesign.com">Cinco Design</a> in Portland OR. At Cinco, I help shape the way we approach digital work. I touch all aspects of the our digital business, including strategy, creative, development and building and sustaining client relationships. I have had the opportunity to work with amazing clients and extremely talented project managers, strategists, designers and developers, in an environment that places huge importance on the power of design and design thinking.</p>
          <p>I rely on a constantly evolving user-centered <a href="https://github.com/austenezzell/process">design process</a> that champions user needs through prototyping, learning and collaboration. I get excited about focused, thoughtful and smart design solutions and my favorite digital experiences are the ones that contain refinements to the things that most people don't notice at first glance. I think good UX conveys emotion and helps define relationships between brands and users.</p>
